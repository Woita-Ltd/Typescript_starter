# README

A simple starter project for working with a Typescript project. 

## Getting started

While in the root directory run npm install in order to retrieve our dependencies:
```
npm install
```
You can now open the __index.html__ file in the web browser of your choice to see the application.

### Lite-server

In order to prevent having to constantly refresh the web browser when you make any changes, lite-server has been included. In order to run this and have the web broser auto update locally:
```
npm start
```
You can now navigate to __http://127.0.0.1:3000__ and begin developing your app.
